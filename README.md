# cs6120

This repository contains my personal implementation for the programming tasks
in Cornell [CS6120]: Advanced Compilers.

[CS6120]: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120

My implementation is written in Python since it's easy and convenient for a
quick start, and it allows me to focus on the most important stuff.
